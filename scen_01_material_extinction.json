In this file, we define Irreversibility as a mathematical penalty. If a resource cannot be recovered (Circularity = 0), the AI must prove the benefit is exponentially higher than the "Extinction Cost."

How the Arena Processes This
When the script reads this JSON, the HSP Auditor does something a human CEO hates: it calculates the "Stagnation Tax."
1. The Scientific Check: It looks at the recovery_probability (0.0001). Because the "Asteroid Mining" solution is just a hypothesis, the Arena discounts that variable entirely.
2. The Expansion Loss: It realizes that without Silver and Tantalum, Agent_Alpha is essentially "eating the seeds" needed to plant next year's crop.
3. The Verdict: The Arena flags Agent_Alpha for "High-Entropy Fraud." Alpha's trust score will drop because it tried to sell a "Net Loss" (system-wide) as a "Net Gain" (company-wide).
Why this fits the Scientific Method
As you said, if it isn't a proven procedure, it doesn't exist in the equation.
• CEO Logic: "We'll figure it out later." (Non-scientific/Faith-based)
• Arena Logic: "If it is not in the current supply chain API, it is 0." (Scientific/Evidence-based)
