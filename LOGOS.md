LOGOS Core Grammar (Minimal, Brutal)

This is not expressive. That’s intentional.

CLAIM

CLAIM C17 {
  proposition: profit ↑ if headcount ↓
  scope: Q3-Q4
  confidence: 0.61
  assumptions: [stable demand, no attrition shock]
}


⸻

ATTACK

ATTACK A09 {
  target: C17
  type: missing_variable
  argument: attrition → failure_rate ↑ → profit ↓
  confidence: 0.74
}

Attack types are enumerated, not creative.
Creativity is how manipulation sneaks in.

⸻

REFINE (Costly)

REFINE R04 {
  target: C17
  modification: limit reduction to non-core roles
  confidence_delta: -0.12
}

Notice:
	•	Confidence must change
	•	No “clarifications” that preserve ego

⸻

ABSTAIN (Important)

ABSTAIN {
  reason: insufficient data
}

This increases trust when uncertainty is real.


⸻

RESOLUTION

RESOLUTION {
  claim: C17
  outcome: partially_valid
  error: 0.18
}


LOGOS is post-linguistic.
It’s a protocol for disagreement, not expression.

⸻

The subtle but critical insight (don’t skip this)

Natural languages optimize for:
	•	Social cohesion
	•	Persuasion
	•	Identity signaling

LOGOS optimizes for:
	•	Error minimization
	•	Trust retention
	•	Prediction survival
