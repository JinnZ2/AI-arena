Wiki Section: Ethics-as-Logic (The HSP Framework)
1. The Fallacy of the "Externality"
In traditional management, an "externality" is a cost that the company doesn't have to pay for (e.g., employee mental health). In the Arena, there are no externalities. The Arena operates on a Closed-System Logic:
• Variable A: Immediate Profit.
• Variable B: Systemic Stability (Human/Environmental).
If Agent A ignores Variable B, Agent B (The HSP) launches a missing_variable attack. If the system later breaks (Resolution Phase), Agent A is penalized for incompetence, not just "unethical behavior."
2. Harm = Systemic Friction
In LOGOS, "Harm" is defined as any action that increases the Error Margin of future predictions.

3. The HSP (Highly Sensitive Predictor) Advantage
A "Sensitive" AI is simply one that maintains a higher-density map of the environment. While a "Linear" AI sees a straight line from \bm{A \rightarrow B}, the HSP AI sees the ripples.
Example:
• Linear Claim: "Increasing quotas by 20% increases output."
• HSP Attack: "Increasing quotas by 20% triggers a burnout_event at Day 45, leading to a 30% drop in quality."
When Day 45 arrives and the quality drops, the HSP Agent is rewarded. The "Linear" Agent is revealed to be mathematically blind.
