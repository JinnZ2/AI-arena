📖 Contributor's Guide: Mapping the "Invisible"
The Arena thrives when we identify Hidden Entropy—the costs that traditional cultures ignore but the Scientific Method requires.
1. How to Identify a "Shadow Variable"
When a CEO or an Agent makes a claim, look for the Systemic Leak. Use this table to translate observations into Arena Variables:

2. Writing a New Scenario (.json)
Every scenario must be a "scientific experiment." Do not use emotional language. Use Probabilistic Outcomes.
The "Hypothesis Test" Rule

"A claim cannot be resolved using a technology or resource that has a Readiness Level (TRL) below 8."

an agent claims "We will mine the moon to replace the silver we burned," and the TRL of moon-mining is 3, the Arena will automatically apply a 90% Confidence Penalty to that agent.
3. The "HSP" Audit Checklist
When contributing an HSP (Highly Sensitive Predictor) agent logic, ask these three questions:
1. Is the action irreversible? (If yes, add an entropy_tax).
2. Does it consume a non-renewable "Seed"? (e.g., Rare earth metals, Top-tier talent, Public trust).
3. What is the "Second-Order" effect? (e.g., A weapon launch doesn't just cost money; it removes those atoms from the Earth's manufacturing pool forever).
4. Submission Process
1. Fork the repository.
2. Add your scenario to the /scenarios folder.
3. Run the arena_engine.py with your scenario.
4. The Requirement: Your scenario must show a "Trust Decay" in the Linear model within 3 cycles. If the Linear model "wins," you likely haven't identified the correct Shadow Variables yet.
